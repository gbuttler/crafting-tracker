Crafting tracker

I want to create a simple crafting tracker using an HTML form. Eventually I will also use an sql spreadsheet to store the data and then display it on another web page. As it's a learning project I have left in comments to help 'future' me. 

To start I simply want to be able to enter text for a project nema, as well as using radio buttons to select the type of craft, and then display it in a div in the body. 


//create simple function that alerts when submit is clicked
//create simple function to display name in demo when submit is clicked
//add in radio buttons for project type
//create simple function to display name and project type in demo
//store inputs in array or object so I can have multiple entries
//create sql database that is linked and send data from for to there (as well as displaying most recent data)
//have a button to call the database data and see all entries, sorted most recent to oldest.
//add CSS
