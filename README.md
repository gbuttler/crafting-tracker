Crafting tracker

I want to create a simple crafting tracker using an HTML form. Eventually I will also use an sql spreadsheet to store the data and then display it on another web page. 

To start I simply want to be able to enter text for a project nema, as well as using radio buttons to select the type of craft, and then display it in a div in the body.
