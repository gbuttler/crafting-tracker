Crafting tracker

I want to create a simple crafting tracker using an HTML form. Eventually I will also use an sql spreadsheet to store the data and then display it on another web page. As it's a learning project I have left in comments to help 'future' me. 

Steps:


1. create simple function that logs when submit is clicked
2. create simple function to display name in demo when submit is clicked
3. add in radio buttons for project type
4. create simple function to display name and project type in demo
5. store inputs in array or object so I can have multiple entries
6. create sql database that is linked and send data from for to there (as well as displaying most recent data)
7. have a button to call the database data and see all entries, sorted most recent to oldest.
8. add CSS
